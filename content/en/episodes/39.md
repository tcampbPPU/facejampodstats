## Facts

1. Our previous TGI Fridaysâ„¢ episode was released June 9th 2020 where we ate the Loaded Cheese Fry Burger, it received an average score of 44. Not great.

2. Fridays is currently being sued because their mozzarella sticks don't contain any mozzarella. This is the same restaurant that was sued for not having potatoes in their potato skins. So I guess my question is what the fuck did we just eat?

3. In 2019 a New Jersey man sued Fridays for not putting their prices on menus to deliberate swindle customers. Our menu had the prices clearly listed, but after eating we have decided to sue Fridays just to be safe.
